# Face Recognition Using Haar Cascade

This repository contains a project focused on face recognition using the Haar Cascade algorithm. The project leverages OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks, to detect and recognize faces in images and videos.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to implement face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers, a machine learning object detection method used to identify faces in images or video streams. This approach is particularly effective for frontal and profile face detection.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers for detecting faces in images and videos.
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Supports real-time face detection through webcam input.
- **Image Processing**: Includes functionality for processing images to enhance face detection accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install OpenCV, which can be done via pip:
